                        ## Why purely functional parallelism?

                        * Modern computers have multiple cores/multiple CPUs
                        * Shared mutable memory remains hard
                            * Race conditions
                            * Deadlocks
                            * Testing is difficult
                        * We want to be able to use the substitution model and reason about
                          our code, _by separating the concern of
                          describing a computation from actually running it_.

                            Note:
                            To start with, let's look at an example that we can refer back to
                            in order to make things a little more concrete.

                            Summing a list of integers:

                            ```scala
                            def sum(ints: Seq[Int]): Int =
                                ints.foldLeft(0)((a,b) => a + b)

                            Same operation, using a divide-and-conquer algorithm:

                            ```scala
                            def sum(ints: IndexedSeq[Int]): Int =
                                if (ints.size <= 1)
                                    ints.headOption getOrElse 0
                                else {
                                    val (l,r) = ints.splitAt(ints.length / 2)
                                    sum(l) + sum(r)
                                }
                            ```

                            (this implementation can be parallelised)

                            Note:
                            Summing integers is probably so fast that the overhead of parallelisation is
                            probably greater than the improvement from running in parallel.

                            However, we don't care about the operation - we want to build a simple
                            and composable set of core data types and functions for parallelism.

                            ### An initial data type for parallel computations

                            First, a container type for our results:

                            ```scala
                            Par[A]
                            ```

                            Second, a function to create a 'unit' of parallelism:

                            ```scala
                            def unit[A](a: => A): Par[A]
                            ```

                            Third, a method to extract the value from a parallel computation:

                            ```scala
                            def get[A](a: Par[A]): A
                            ```

                            Note:
                            For now, we don't need to worry about what other functions we require,
                            or internal representation of `Par`.
                        </script>
                    </section>
                    <section data-markdown>
                        <script type="text/template">
                            Let's change our `sum` example to use this API:

                            ```scala
                            def sum(ints: IndexedSeq[Int]): Int =
                                if (ints.size <= 1)
                                    ints headOption getOrElse 0
                                else {
                                    val (l,r) = ints.splitAt(ints.length/2)
                                    val sumL: Par[Int] = Par.unit(sum(l))
                                    val sumR: Par[Int] = Par.unit(sum(r))
                                    Par.get(sumL) + Par.get(sumR)
                                }
                            ```

                            Should `unit` start evaluating its argument immediately, or wait?

                            Note:
                            - In this example, `unit` must start evaluating immediately to get any parallelism
                                - Because if we wait until `get` is called while evaluating the first argument
                                  to our `+` function, we will spawn the computation and wait for it
                                  immediately, before starting the second computation
                        </script>

                            Is

                            ```scala

                            val sumR: Par[Int] = Par.unit(sum(r))
                            Par.get(sumL) + Par.get(sumR)
                            ```

                            equivalent to

                            ```scala
                            Par.get(Par.unit(sum(l))) + Par.get(Par.unit(sum(r)))
                            ```

                            If `unit` begins evaluating its argument concurrently, then
                            calling `get` arguably breaks _referential transparency_, as our
                            program is no longer parallel

                            An expression `e` is referentially transparent if, for all programs
                            `p`, all occurrences of `e` in `p` can be replaced by the result of
                            evaluating `e` without affecting the meaning of `p`.

                            It's becoming clear that we need to combine asynchronous computations without
                            waiting for them to finish...

                            Note:
                            So if `unit` doesn't start evaluation of a parallel computation immediately,
                            but we want to compute the sums of the two sublists in parallel, then we
                            need some way to combine two parallel computations to create a third.

                            We have:
                            - Conjoured up a simple example
                            - Explored it to uncover a design choice
                            - Experimented and learned something fundamental about our domain

                            ### Combining parallel computations

                            Imagine a function `map2`, defined as:

                            ```scala
                            def map2[A,B,C](a: Par[A], b: Par[B])(f: (A,B) => C): Par[C]
                            ```

                            We can use this in our example:

                            ```scala
                            def sum(ints: IndexedSeq[Int]): Par[Int] =
                                if (ints.size <= 1)
                                    Par.unit(ints.headOption getOrElse 0)
                                else {
                                    val (l,r) = ints.splitAt(ints.length/2)
                                    Par.map2(sum(l), sum(r))(_ + _)
                                }
                            ```

                            Note:
                            So we're now no longer calling `unit` or `get` in our recursive case,
                            and `map2` is free to start evaluating both its arguments in parallel.
                        </script>

                            Now, should `map2` take its arguments lazily?

                            Note:
                            If `map2` takes its arguments strictly, then the first argument will be
                            fully constructed before we even consider the second argument.

                            Seems we should make `map2` lazy and have it begin execution of both
                            sides in parallel.

                            ### Explicit forking

                            Do we _always_ want to evaluate the two arguments to `map2` in parallel?

                            What about in this simple case?

                            ```scala
                            Par.map2(Par.unit(1), Par.unit(1))(_ + _)
                            ```

                            Note:
                            With our current API, there is no way for the caller to say whether
                            a computation should be forked onto a separate thread.

                            Introducing `fork`:
                            ```scala
                            def fork[A](a: => Par[A]): Par[A]
                            ```

                            Adding this to our `sum` example:

                            ```scala
                            def sum(ints: IndexedSeq[Int]): Par[Int] =
                                if (ints.length <= 1)
                                    Par.unit(ints.headOption getOrElse 0)
                                else {
                                    val (l,r) = ints.splitAt(ints.length/2)
                                    Par.map2(Par.fork(sum(l)), Par.fork(sum(r)))(_ + _)
                                }
                            ```

                            We've put the parallelism explicitly under programmer control, no arbitrary decision making here!

                            Note:
                            Let's introduce a new primitive for the caller to specify if a computation
                            needs to be forked onto a separate thread:

                            This solves the problem of instantiating our
                            parallel computations too strictly, but more fundamentally

                            Should `unit` be strict or lazy?

                            Thanks to `fork`, we can make it strict.

                            ```scala
                            def unit[A](a: A): Par[A]
                            def lazyUnit[A](a: => A): Par[A] = fork(unit(a))
                            ```

                            `lazyUnit` is a simple example of a <del>contrived</del> _derived_
                            combinator, as opposed to a _primitive_ combinator like `unit`.

                            Note:
                            We haven't actually defined `unit` anywhere yet - we will get to that later

                            One more decision - should `fork` begin evaluating arguments immediately,
                            or wait until the computation is forced? (e.g. by a call to `get`)?

                            Note:
                            If `fork` is to start computation immediately, it must be doing so
                            using some globally accessible resource (such as a thread pool)

                            Alternatively, `fork` can just 'mark' an unevaluated `Par` for concurrent
                            evaluation, which seems a nicer choice than requiring existence of some
                            global resource.

                            `Par` is now a pure data structure, and `run` has to have some means of
                            implementing the parallelism...

                            For now, let's assume an `ExecutorService` is appropriate:

                            ```scala
                            def run[A](s: ExecutorService)(a: Par[A]): A
                            ```
                            Now, if we define `Par[A]` to be:
                            ```scala
                            type Par[A] = ExecutorService => Future[A]
                            ```
                            Then `run` becomes trivial to implement:
                            ```scala
                            def run[A](s: ExecutorService)(a: Par[A]): Future[A] = a(s)
                            ```

                            Note:
                            By having `Par[A]` defined this way, we give the caller the ability to
                            choose how long to wait for a computation or whether to cancel it etc.

                            `Par` is a function that needs an `ExecutorService`, so the creation
                            of the `Future` doesn't happen until it's provided.

                            - `map2` doesn't evaluate `f` in a separate logical thread, caller can
                              wrap it in `fork` if they want that
                            - To support timeouts in `map2`, we'd need a new implementation of `Future`
                              that keeps track of the amount of time spend evaluating `af`

                                - The callable we pass to `es.submit` will block waiting for the

                            def parMap[A,B](ps: List[A])(f: A => B): Par[List[B]] = fork {
                              val fbs: List[Par[B]] = ps.map(asyncF(f))

                            }
                            ```

                            Note:
                            We're wrapping the body of `parMap` in a `fork` - it will always return
                            immediately, and when we call `run` later it will spawn a computation
                            which itself spawns `N` computations

                            ### The law of mapping

                            A concrete example:
                            ```scala
                            map(unit(1))(_ + 1) == unit(2)
                            ```

                            or more generally:

                            ```scala
                            map(unit(x))(f) == unit(f(x))
                            ```

                            and when `f` is `id`:

                            ```scala
                            map(unit(x))(id) == unit(id(x))
                            map(unit(x))(id) == unit(x)
                            map(   y   )(id) == y
                            ```

                            Note:
                            Here we are saying this should hold for _any_ choice of `f` and `x`, which places
                            some useful constraints:

                            - Our implementation of `unit` can't inspect the provided values and
                              behave differently depending on input
                                - So no downcasting or `isInstanceOf` checks

                            Given these constraints, we can reason about what happens when
                            `f` is `id`, which leads us to a simpler law that doesn't mention
                            `unit` at all.

                            Laws like these are very handy when reasoning about your code
                            and when testing it using property based testing, as we will see
                            in the enxt chapter.

                            ### The law of forking

                            `fork` should not affect the result of a parallel computation:

                            ```scala
                            fork(x) == x
                            ```

                            This places strong constraints on our implementation.

                            Note:
                            We’re expecting that `fork(x) == x` for all choices of `x`, and
                            any choice of ExecutorService.

                            Some ExecutorServices are backed by a fixed size thread pool...

                            #### A subtle bug

                            ```scala
                            val a = lazyUnit(42 + 1)
                            val S = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(1)
                            println(Par.equal(S)(a, fork(a)))
                            ```

                            Note:
                            Remember earlier, the issue with our implementation of `fork`?

                            We’re submitting the Callable first, and within that Callable,
                            we’re submitting another Callable to the ExecutorService and
                            blocking on its result

                            There is no way to fix this - we need a different representation
                            for `Par`.

                            Note:
                            Functional design is an iterative process, when using an API
                            you might find some new combinator that you need.

                            Sometimes this combinator is just a special form of a more
                            general combinator.

                            ### Choosing between computations

                            Given a computation, use it to choose another:

                            ```scala
                            def choice[A](cond: Par[Boolean])(t: Par[A], f: Par[A]): Par[A]
                            ```

                            We can make this more general by allowing `n` alternatives:

                            ```scala
                            def choiceN[A](n: Par[Int])(choices: List[Par[A]]): Par[A]
                            ```

                            But why require a list of alternatives?

                            ```scala
                            def chooser[A,B](pa: Par[A])(choices: A => Par[B]): Par[B]
                            ```

                            Note:
                            Why restrict the caller to just two alternatives?

                            The type signature of `chooser` may look familiar to functions we've
                            seen in the earlier sections...
                        </script>
                    </section>
                    <section data-markdown>
                        <script type="text/template">
                            ```scala
                            def chooser[A,B](pa: Par[A])(choices: A => Par[B]): Par[B]
                            def flatMap[A,B](fa:   F[A])(   f   : A =>   F[B]):   F[B]
                            ```

                            Note:
                            As we have seen in most chapters, if we abstract enough we end up
                            with `flatmap` and `sequence` and friends. We've seen `flatMap`
                            specialised for lists and random number generators, but `flatMap`
                            is a very general function that we will look into in more detail
                            later.

                            We could try to take this process of generalistion further, but
                            by now you probably get the point - before implementing a specific
                            combinator, look to see if it's actually a specific case of a more
                            general combinator that could be reused elsewhere.

                            - Completed the design of a library for defining parallel and

                            - Explored the process of functional design to gain a sense of the
                              challenges and solutions
                            - Explored what it means for an API to form an _algebra_

                            Defining a property:

                            ```scala
                            val intList = Gen.listOf(Gen.choose(0,100))

                            val prop =
                                forAll(intList)(ns => ns.reverse.reverse == ns) &&
                                forAll(intList)(ns => ns.headOption == ns.reverse.lastOption)
                            ```

                            Checking a property:

                            ```
                            scala> prop.check
                            + OK, passed 100 tests.

                            Note:
                            - These are examples from `ScalaCheck`
                            - Here `intList` is a generator of list of integers
                            - `forAll` creates a property by combining a generator with a predicate
                            - In the case of failure, ScalaCheck will also minimise test cases to
                              the smallest failing case

                            A type for a generator for values of type `A`:

                            ```scala
                            Gen[A]
                            ```

                            A function to create a generator for lists of values of type `A`:
                            ```scala
                            def listOfN[A](n: Int, a: Gen[A]): Gen[List[A]]
                            ```

                            A function to create a property:

                            ```scala
                            def forAll[A](a: Gen[A])(f: A => Boolean): Prop
                            ```

                            Note:
                            - We'll need something for a generator of values of type `A`
                            - As long as `listOf` is told how to generate values to put
                              in the list, it doesn't need to care about the type of elements in
                              the list, so we can make it polymorphic
                            - `listOfN` is told how long to make the list, this way it stays flexible
                            - That last line sneaks in the introduction of the `Prop`
                              type as well - remember we don't need to know about
                              the representation of a type to start using it in
                              this way!

                            ### API of properties

                            So far our API consists of `forAll`, `&&` and `check`.

                            Simplest respresentation:

                            ```scala
                            trait Prop { def check: Boolean }
                            ```

                            Better representation:

                            ```scala
                            object Prop {
                                type FailedCase = String
                                type SuccessCount = Int
                            }

                            trait Prop { def check: Either[FailedCase,SuccessCount] }
                            ```

                            Note:
                            - So we can create, `Prop`s, combine them and `check` them
                            - ...
                            - We haven't considered the arguments to `check` yet - let's take a look at generators first
                        </script>

                            What if we just wrap a state transition and randomly generate values?

                            ```scala
                            case class Gen[A](sample: State[RNG,A])
                            ```

                            Note:
                            - We could just make Gen a type that wraps a State transition over a random number generator:

                            How could we make a `Gen[(String,String)]` where the second string contains only
                            characters from the first?


                            ```scala

                            ### Refining the Prop data type

                            We can't just continue checking a `Prop` indefinitely - we need to be told
                            when to stop!

                            ```scala
                            type TestCases = Int
                            type Result = Option[(FailedCase, SuccessCount)]

                            ```

                            Note:
                            Here we're using an `Option`/`Maybe` for a result, where `None` is success,
                            which is a litle confusing. The book goes on to add a more explicit
                            `Result` type

                            `Prop.run` will also require a `RNG` to sample from the `Gen`, so we'll
                            add that:
                            ```scala

                              (n,rng) => randomStream(as)(rng).zip(Stream.from(0)).take(n).map {
                                case (a, i) => try {

                            }

                            Note:
                            We now know enough to implement `forAll`.

                            We catch exceptions so that we can report which input caused them.

                            It would be best if our framework finds the simplest failing test case to make analysis easier.

                            ScalaCheck does this via shrinking - we're going to do it via sized generation.
