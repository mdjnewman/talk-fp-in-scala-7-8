                        ## Why purely functional parallelism?

                        * Modern computers have multiple cores/multiple CPUs
                        * Shared mutable memory remains hard
                            * Race conditions
                            * Deadlocks
                            * Testing is difficult
                        * We want to be able to use the substitution model and reason about
                          our code, _by separating the concern of
                          describing a computation from actually running it_.

                            Note:
                            To start with, let's look at an example that we can refer back to
                            in order to make things a little more concrete.

                            Summing a list of integers:

                            ```scala
                            def sum(ints: Seq[Int]): Int =
                                ints.foldLeft(0)((a,b) => a + b)

                            Same operation, using a divide-and-conquer algorithm:

                            ```scala
                            def sum(ints: IndexedSeq[Int]): Int =
                                if (ints.size <= 1)
                                    ints.headOption getOrElse 0
                                else {
                                    val (l,r) = ints.splitAt(ints.length / 2)
                                    sum(l) + sum(r)
                                }
                            ```

                            (this implementation can be parallelised)

                            Note:
                            Summing integers is probably so fast that the overhead of parallelisation is
                            probably greater than the improvement from running in parallel.

                            However, we don't care about the operation - we want to build a simple
                            and composable set of core data types and functions for parallelism.

                            ### An initial data type for parallel computations

                            First, a container type for our results:

                            ```scala
                            Par[A]
                            ```

                            Second, a function to create a 'unit' of parallelism:

                            ```scala
                            def unit[A](a: => A): Par[A]
                            ```

                            Third, a method to extract the value from a parallel computation:

                            ```scala
                            def get[A](a: Par[A]): A
                            ```

                            Note:
                            For now, we don't need to worry about what other functions we require,
                            or internal representation of `Par`.
                        </script>
                    </section>
                    <section data-markdown>
                        <script type="text/template">
                            Let's change our `sum` example to use this API:

                            ```scala
                            def sum(ints: IndexedSeq[Int]): Int =
                                if (ints.size <= 1)
                                    ints headOption getOrElse 0
                                else {
                                    val (l,r) = ints.splitAt(ints.length/2)
                                    val sumL: Par[Int] = Par.unit(sum(l))
                                    val sumR: Par[Int] = Par.unit(sum(r))
                                    Par.get(sumL) + Par.get(sumR)
                                }
                            ```

                            Should `unit` start evaluating its argument immediately, or wait?

                            Note:
                            - In this example, `unit` must start evaluating immediately to get any parallelism
                                - Because if we wait until `get` is called while evaluating the first argument
                                  to our `+` function, we will spawn the computation and wait for it
                                  immediately, before starting the second computation
                        </script>

                            Is

                            ```scala
                            val sumL: Par[Int] = Par.unit(sum(l))
                            val sumR: Par[Int] = Par.unit(sum(r))
                            Par.get(sumL) + Par.get(sumR)
                            ```

                            equivalent to

                            ```scala
                            Par.get(Par.unit(sum(l))) + Par.get(Par.unit(sum(r)))
                            ```

                            If `unit` begins evaluating its argument concurrently, then
                            calling `get` arguably breaks _referential transparency_, as our
                            program is no longer parallel

                            An expression `e` is referentially transparent if, for all programs
                            `p`, all occurrences of `e` in `p` can be replaced by the result of
                            evaluating `e` without affecting the meaning of `p`.

                            It's becoming clear that we need to combine asynchronous computations without
                            waiting for them to finish...

                            Note:
                            So if `unit` doesn't start evaluation of a parallel computation immediately,
                            but we want to compute the sums of the two sublists in parallel, then we
                            need some way to combine two parallel computations to create a third.

                            We have:
                            - Conjoured up a simple example
                            - Explored it to uncover a design choice
                            - Experimented and learned something fundamental about our domain

                            ### Combining parallel computations

                            Imagine a function `map2`, defined as:

                            ```scala
                            def map2[A,B,C](a: Par[A], b: Par[B])(f: (A,B) => C): Par[C]
                            ```

                            We can use this in our example:

                            ```scala
                            def sum(ints: IndexedSeq[Int]): Par[Int] =
                                if (ints.size <= 1)
                                    Par.unit(ints.headOption getOrElse 0)
                                else {
                                    val (l,r) = ints.splitAt(ints.length/2)
                                    Par.map2(sum(l), sum(r))(_ + _)
                                }
                            ```

                            Note:
                            So we're now no longer calling `unit` or `get` in our recursive case,
                            and `map2` is free to start evaluating both its arguments in parallel.
                        </script>

                            Now, should `map2` take its arguments lazily?

                            Note:
                            If `map2` takes its arguments strictly, then the first argument will be
                            fully constructed before we even consider the second argument.

                            Seems we should make `map2` lazy and have it begin execution of both
                            sides in parallel.

                            ### Explicit forking

                            Do we _always_ want to evaluate the two arguments to `map2` in parallel?

                            What about in this simple case?

                            ```scala
                            Par.map2(Par.unit(1), Par.unit(1))(_ + _)
                            ```

                            Note:
                            With our current API, there is no way for the caller to say whether
                            a computation should be forked onto a separate thread.

                            Introducing `fork`:
                            ```scala
                            def fork[A](a: => Par[A]): Par[A]
                            ```

                            Adding this to our `sum` example:

                            ```scala
                            def sum(ints: IndexedSeq[Int]): Par[Int] =
                                if (ints.length <= 1)
                                    Par.unit(ints.headOption getOrElse 0)
                                else {
                                    val (l,r) = ints.splitAt(ints.length/2)
                                    Par.map2(Par.fork(sum(l)), Par.fork(sum(r)))(_ + _)
                                }
                            ```

                            We've put the parallelism explicitly under programmer control, no arbitrary decision making here!

                            Note:
                            Let's introduce a new primitive for the caller to specify if a computation
                            needs to be forked onto a separate thread:

                            This solves the problem of instantiating our
                            parallel computations too strictly, but more fundamentally

                            Should `unit` be strict or lazy?

                            Thanks to `fork`, we can make it strict.

                            ```scala
                            def unit[A](a: A): Par[A]
                            def lazyUnit[A](a: => A): Par[A] = fork(unit(a))
                            ```

                            `lazyUnit` is a simple example of a <del>contrived</del> _derived_
                            combinator, as opposed to a _primitive_ combinator like `unit`.

                            Note:
                            We haven't actually defined `unit` anywhere yet - we will get to that later

                            One more decision - should `fork` begin evaluating arguments immediately,
                            or wait until the computation is forced? (e.g. by a call to `get`)?

                            Note:
                            If `fork` is to start computation immediately, it must be doing so
                            using some globally accessible resource (such as a thread pool)

                            Alternatively, `fork` can just 'mark' an unevaluated `Par` for concurrent
                            evaluation, which seems a nicer choice than requiring existence of some
                            global resource.

                            `Par` is now a pure data structure, and `run` has to have some means of
                            implementing the parallelism...

                            So far we've just been assuming that `run` has some way of implementing

                            For now, let's assume an `ExecutorService` is appropriate:

                            ```scala
                            def run[A](s: ExecutorService)(a: Par[A]): A
                            ```
                            Now, if we define `Par[A]` to be:
                            ```scala
                            type Par[A] = ExecutorService => Future[A]
                            ```
                            Then `run` becomes trivial to implement:
                            ```scala
                            def run[A](s: ExecutorService)(a: Par[A]): Future[A] = a(s)
                            ```

                            Note:
                            By having `Par[A]` defined this way, we give the caller the ability to
                            choose how long to wait for a computation or whether to cancel it etc.

                            `Par` is a function that needs an `ExecutorService`, so the creation
                            of the `Future` doesn't happen until it's provided.

                            - `map2` doesn't evaluate `f` in a separate logical thread, caller can
                              wrap it in `fork` if they want that
                            - To support timeouts in `map2`, we'd need a new implementation of `Future`
                              that keeps track of the amount of time spend evaluating `af`

                                - The callable we pass to `es.submit` will block waiting for the

                            Note:
                            We're wrapping the body of `parMap` in a `fork` - it will always return
                            immediately, and when we call `run` later it will spawn a computation
                            which itself spawns `N` computations

                            ### The law of mapping

                            A concrete example:
                            ```scala
                            map(unit(1))(_ + 1) == unit(2)
                            ```

                            or more generally:

                            ```scala
                            map(unit(x))(f) == unit(f(x))
                            ```

                            and when `f` is `id`:

                            ```scala
                            map(unit(x))(id) == unit(id(x))
                            map(unit(x))(id) == unit(x)
                            map(   y   )(id) == y
                            ```

                            Note:
                            Here we are saying this should hold for _any_ choice of `f` and `x`, which places
                            some useful constraints:

                            - Our implementation of `unit` can't inspect the provided values and
                              behave differently depending on input
                                - So no downcasting or `isInstanceOf` checks

                            Given these constraints, we can reason about what happens when
                            `f` is `id`, which leads us to a simpler law that doesn't mention
                            `unit` at all.

                            Laws like these are very handy when reasoning about your code
                            and when testing it using property based testing, as we will see
                            in the enxt chapter.

                            ### The law of forking

                            `fork` should not affect the result of a parallel computation:

                            ```scala
                            fork(x) == x
                            ```

                            This places strong constraints on our implementation.

                            Note:
                            We’re expecting that `fork(x) == x` for all choices of `x`, and
                            any choice of ExecutorService.

                            Some ExecutorServices are backed by a fixed size thread pool...

                            #### A subtle bug

                            ```scala
                            val a = lazyUnit(42 + 1)
                            val S = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(1)
                            println(Par.equal(S)(a, fork(a)))
                            ```

                            Note:
                            Remember earlier, the issue with our implementation of `fork`?

                            We’re submitting the Callable first, and within that Callable,
                            we’re submitting another Callable to the ExecutorService and
                            blocking on its result

                            There is no way to fix this - we need a different representation
                            for `Par`.
